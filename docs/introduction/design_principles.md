# Design Principles

Orion Finance is built on a core belief: permissionless, modular financial infrastructure can enable powerful new forms of collaboration and value creation - while reducing systemic risk and complexity.

This page outlines the key design principles that guide how we are building Orion.

## Permissionless

Anyone shall be able to make use of Orion's infrastructure to:
- Launch a vault;
- Deploy a strategy and build a track record;
- Access performance data;
- Provide or manage capital.

By making vault deployment and strategy execution **permissionless**, Orion unlocks network effects and innovation from a wider ecosystem — from DAOs and quants to protocol-native asset managers.

## Privacy and Auditability

Vault curation and professional strategy deployment are critical to DeFi’s future - but they’re unsustainable without confidentiality.

Orion integrates confidential smart contracts using advanced cryptography (e.g., fhEVM) to protect manager alpha and user allocations while preserving auditability. This enables:
- Encrypted strategy execution;
- Private vault holdings and trades;
- Verifiable, transparent performance;
- Protection from MEV and copycats.

In doing so, Orion brings **institutional-grade privacy** into a permissionless, trustless, and composable DeFi environment - empowering scalable and competitive onchain asset management.

At the same time, Orion is built on-chain from the ground up. Vault logic, incentives, and reporting are all verifiable and transparent. This transparency is essential for trust, composability, and long-term resilience.

## Modularity

Orion is modular by design — separating vault logic, strategy execution, and value flow — so each part can evolve independently. This composable architecture lets asset managers, protocols, and individuals plug in only what they need.
 With clean APIs, transparent performance, and extensible logic, Orion isn’t a black box — it’s collaborative infrastructure built for a permissionless, onchain future.

## Abstracting Complexity

Our goal is to **abstract** financial complexity, not hide it. The protocol shall serve both skilled quants and casual depositors - with different layers of abstraction.
