# Design Principles

Orion Finance is built on a core belief: permissionless, modular financial infrastructure can enable powerful new forms of collaboration and value creation — while reducing systemic risk and complexity.

This page outlines the key design principles that guide how we are building Orion.

## Modularity

Complexity is the enemy of composability. Our protocol is modular by design, separating concerns across vault logic, strategy execution, and value flow. This modularity allows each piece of the system to evolve independently while remaining easy to reason about.

Rather than building a monolith, Orion enables asset managers, protocols, and individuals to plug into a customizable vault infrastructure — with just the pieces they need.

## Permissionless

Anyone shall be able to make use of Orion's infrastructure to:
- Launch a vault;
- Deploy a strategy and build a track record;
- Access performance data;
- Provide or manage capital.

By making vault deployment and strategy execution **permissionless**, Orion unlocks network effects and innovation from a wider ecosystem — from DAOs and quants to protocol-native asset managers.

## Transparency

Orion is built on-chain from the ground up. Vault logic, incentives, and reporting are all verifiable and transparent — not offchain or hidden behind APIs.

This transparency is essential for trust, composability, and long-term resilience.

## Abstracting Complexity

Our goal is to **abstract** financial complexity, not hide it. The protocol shall serve both skilled quants and casual depositors — with different layers of abstraction.

## Built for Collaboration

Orion isn’t a black box — it’s infrastructure others can build on.

We prioritize clean APIs, visibility into vault performance, and extensibility across vault types and strategy logic. Whether you’re a DAO, an asset manager, or a DeFi builder, Orion is designed to support your workflows.

These principles help us build something lasting — infrastructure that supports a permissionless, collaborative future of onchain asset management.
