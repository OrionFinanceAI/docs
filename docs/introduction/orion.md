# What is Orion Finance?

[TODO: if title moves below, it messes the title showing right on the left sidebar]

Orion Finance is a **permissionless portfolio management protocol** designed to optimize onchain capital efficiency while minimizing gas costs for users. It enables anyone to create, manage, and invest in structured portfolios through **modular, yield-bearing vaults**.

At its core, Orion is building a next-generation permissionless infrastructure that democratizes access to advanced portfolio strategies.


## Why Does Orion Exist?

DeFi is powerful, but fragmented and riddled with inefficiencies. Traditional vaults are **gas-intensive, inefficient, and lack composability**.

Orion aims to **bridge this gap** by providing structured infrastructure that allows for:
- **Modularity** – Vaults can be customized for different risk/reward profiles.  
- **Efficiency** – Gas batching and peer-to-peer netting reduce costs.  
- **Permissionlessness** – Anyone can create and manage portfolios, without gatekeepers.  


## Key Features

### Batching & Gas Netting  
Orion **batches transactions** across multiple users to **democratize gas costs**. In some cases, **peer-to-peer bartering** can further optimize execution, minimizing unnecessary gas fees.

### Composable Vaults (ERC-4626+)  
Vaults are **ERC-4626-compliant** but extend beyond single-asset yield strategies, supporting **multi-asset rebalancing** with automated execution.

### Powered by fhEVM  
Orion leverages **fully homomorphic encryption (fhEVM)** to enhance privacy while maintaining transparency.


## Orion's Role in the Ecosystem

Orion is not just another DeFi vault protocol. It’s **infrastructure** — a foundational layer for asset managers, DAOs, and users seeking better onchain portfolio management.

Instead of competing with existing protocols, Orion enhances their efficiency and **makes DeFi asset management scalable**.


## The Road Ahead

Orion will evolve into **fully permissionless infrastructure** that supports **customizable, efficient, and intelligent DeFi portfolio management**.
