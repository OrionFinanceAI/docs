# Vaults

[TODO: discuss both permissionless and composable aspects.]

Orion Finance is **fully permissionless**, meaning anyone can create, manage, and invest in vaults without requiring approval or whitelisting. 

This open design ensures that **portfolio management is decentralized and composable**, enabling broader innovation and capital efficiency in DeFi.


## Why Permissionless Matters

Traditional asset management platforms allow only on approved entities to launch funds or deploy investment strategies. This:
- Limits innovation to pre-approved participants
- Reduces accessibility for non-institutional users
- Creates inefficiencies in strategy discovery and execution

Orion takes a **radically different approach**, where **anyone can create and customize vaults**.

This model:
- **Encourages competition** ‚Äì The best vaults attract deposits based on performance, not exclusivity.  
- **Removes barriers to entry** ‚Äì No need for approval to launch a portfolio strategy.  
- **Expands composability** ‚Äì Vaults can integrate freely with other protocols.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Permissionless Vaults Work

Orion vaults follow the **ERC-4626 standard**, making them **interoperable, composable, and extendable**.

### Key Aspects:
1. **Anyone Can Deploy a Vault**  
   - No whitelisting or permission required.
   - Vault creators define **strategy parameters, risk levels, and assets**.

2. **Open Strategy Execution**  [TODO: ??]
   - Strategies can be **hardcoded, algorithmic, or dynamically managed**.  
   - Performance data is **transparent and verifiable onchain**.

3. **Composability and Integration**  [TODO: ??]
   - Vaults can be **used as collateral**, **stacked together**, or **wrapped into structured products**.

4. **Non-Custodial and Trustless**  [TODO: ??]
   - **No centralized control** over vaults once deployed.  
   - Users can **withdraw anytime** based on vault rules.

## Permissionless Vault Creation Flow

1. **Define Vault Parameters**  
   - Asset selection, rebalancing frequency, deposit/withdrawal logic.

2. **Deploy via Orion‚Äôs Smart Contracts**  
   - The vault becomes **onchain, immutable, and discoverable**.

3. **Attract Liquidity**  
   - Performance metrics are onchain, allowing **transparent comparison across vaults**.

4. **Earn Fees Based on Performance**  
   - Vault creators can **earn fees** for strategy execution.  
   - Performance-based incentives drive competition.
