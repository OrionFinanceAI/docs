# Overview

Orion Finance is designed as a modular, permissionless protocol for onchain portfolio management. At its core, it enables the creation and execution of customizable, yield-generating vaults that support multivariate strategies, batch rebalancing, and seamless composability.

This section introduces the architectural pillars that make Orion a flexible and future-proof asset management protocol.


## Modular Vault Architecture

Orion vaults are built around the [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) standard but extend its design to support:
- **Multi-asset portfolios**
- **Dynamic allocation strategies**
- **Custom vault parameters** for different users and managers

Each vault consists of:
- **A controller** (strategy execution logic)
- **A set of whitelisted or permissionless assets set (by Orion Finace)**
- **Performance-tracking and reporting modules**
- **Optional privacy-preserving layers (via fhEVM)**

This modularity allows asset managers to deploy vaults tailored to specific risk/reward profiles.


## Batching & Netting Layer

Orion introduces a **batching and netting mechanism** that:
- Aggregates rebalancing actions across vaults
- Minimizes redundant token transfers
- Shares gas costs across participants

This architecture not only increases **capital efficiency** but also improves **user experience**, especially in high-frequency strategy environments.

In the future, this batching layer may enable **peer-to-peer bartering** of assets (when nettable), further minimizing execution friction.


## Permissionless by Default

Anyone can:
- Launch a vault
- Propose or implement a strategy
- Access performance data

By making vault deployment and strategy execution **permissionless**, Orion unlocks network effects and innovation from a wider ecosystem â€” from DAOs and quants to protocol-native asset managers.


## Machine Learning-Enabled Strategy Abstraction [TODO: should we provide optimisation and risk management for custom strategies?]

A core differentiator for Orion is its ability to **abstract away financial complexity** using machine learning, allowing vault creators to:
- Optimize allocation across multiple assets
- Minimize drawdowns
- Adapt dynamically to market regimes

This abstraction allows everyday users to access intelligent portfolios without needing to manage or understand the strategy mechanics themselves.


## Composability and Integrations [TODO: ??]

Vaults can be used as:
- Inputs to other vaults (recursive portfolios)
- Collateral in lending protocols
- Building blocks in structured products

This makes Orion an ideal substrate for DeFi-native fund managers, structured product designers, or protocols seeking capital-efficient yield routing.


## Foundation for the Future

While Orion aims to become the **infrastructure layer** for permissionless portfolio creation.

Its modular and extensible design allows for:
- Ecosystem vault templates
- Permissionless strategy marketplaces
- Incentive-driven discovery and reputation

Together, these building blocks will form a **robust, standard for onchain portfolio management**.
