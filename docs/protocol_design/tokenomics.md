# Tokenomics

The ORION token is designed to align incentives across vault managers, users, and the protocol itself — while reflecting the value accrued from activity across the ecosystem.

It acts as the primary mechanism through which Orion accrues fees, rewards performance, and facilitates long-term protocol sustainability.

## Vault Fees

Vaults in Orion are permissionless, and can be created by anyone. Regardless of this, they generate fees through:

### Performance and Management Fees
Vault managers have complete flexibility in determining their fee models, which can include:
- **Performance fees** that take a percentage of generated returns;
- **Management fees** charged as percentage of Total Value Locked (TVL).

To ensure aligned incentives, protocol participation and profitabilty, **ORION accrues value proportionally to the fees set by vault managers.**

> **Example**
>
> Alice creates a vault with a 10% performance fee and a 0.5% management fee, has a TVL of $1M and has a Cumulative Gross Return of 15%.
> Alice's vault will generate $20k in fees.
>
> Bob creates a vault with a 20% performance fee and a 0.0% management fee, has a TVL of $500k and has a Cumulative Gross Return of 25%.
> Bob's vault will generate $25k in fees.
>
> Mr. Orion creates a vault with a 5% performance fee and a 1% management fee, has a TVL of $750k and has a Cumulative Gross Return of 12%.
> Mr. Orion's vault will generate $12k in fees.
>
> ORION will fully benefit from the $12k in fees generated by Mr. Orion's vault and proportionally from the $45k in fees generated by third-party vaults, based on the applicable fee-sharing structure.

This system encourages **market-driven fee competition** — where managers can experiment with strategies and pricing models while the protocol benefits from all vaults activity.

## [Batching and Netting](../key_features/batching_netting.md)

Orion introduces **batching and netting layers** to reduce gas costs by combining and offsetting transactions between users, when possible. This feature plays a key role in the protocol’s fee dynamics:

- When transactions are batched and/or netted **within Orion**, users pay **only a fraction** of the typical gas fees.
- A part of the saved cost is redirected to the **Orion protocol treasury**, accruing value in the token.

This creates a strong incentive to use Orion-native infrastructure for capital efficiency and cost savings — while benefiting the protocol.
